Mod ID: 3154319987 (for all those knuckleheads that can't find it in the address bar)

== Background ==

Sometimes you just need to build close to precious resources, but don't want them to not respawn. That's why NoCore Structures was created. Maybe you have cave building enabled and want to build bridges in the lava cave so you don't fall in the lava when you try and jump just as the server is saving!

Structures that are not marked as core structures will not block respawn of resources or dinos as long as they don't intersect with the resource. Pillars, Ramps, Standing Torches, Campfire are examples of structures that vanilla are not marked as core structures. But foundations, ceilings, roofs and walls all are marked as core structures.

== Overview ==

Makes variants of the Wood, Adobe, Stone and Metal structures for Foundations, Triangle Foundations, Ceilings, Triangle Ceilings and Railings that are not marked as Core structures. Thatch is just to fragile, and who would want to waste element to build Tek structures!!

The Metal structures are crafted in the Smithy and those smithy like dinos (Argentavis, Casteroides, Spiny Lizard) and the other are crafted in your inventory. The same as the vanilla structures. Krakens Better Dino's Doedicurus has stone versions added. Need to have Krakens Better Dinos before this mod in the load order. KBD is optional, nothing will happen if you don't have it.

Thanks to Kozenomenon's AnyStationOS there is no longer a need to place a new smithy after the mod is installed for the items to show up. Also enables the items to be crafted in Structures Plus Smithy. Structures Plus needs to be before this mod in the load order. Having Structures Plus is optional, but the mod supports it if it is installed.

Additional foundation support distance configurable in the ini.

GameUserSettings.ini
[NoCoreStructures]
AddCraftStations=*Smithy*
DebugMode=False
AdditionalSupportDistanceInFoundations=0

With AddCraftStations you can add the items to any crafting station you want. Comma delimited list of matches texts. Matches against the structure's class name/path and the default in game display name. If not set in the ini will use "*smithy*". 

Example AddCraftStations=*Smithy*,*Replicator*,*Fabric* will add the items to Smithy, Tek Replicator and the Fabricator. If S+ is installed then S+ Smithy, S+ Tek Replicator and S+ Fabricator will also have the items added.

AdditionalSupportDistanceInFoundations specifies how long in foundations support is extended beyond the 2 that is default.

And NO. This mod will NOT be ported to ASA because. A: I don't have a computer powerful enough to run ASA. B: I don't own ASA.

== Changed ==

Added
Engrams, Items and Structures for Wood, Adobe, Stone and Metal versions of the Fundation, Triangle Foundation, Ceilings, Triangle Ceilings and Railings. (To many names to list here)

== About me ==

I'm and old retires software engineer (not games thou) that have done mods for games like Conan Exile and Minecraft among others. I have used the Ark Dev kit for several years now, but never made a mod in it. I'm still learning how to do stuff with it since it's very different then from how you do stuff for Conan Exile even thou it's basically the same tool. So I know what I'm doing, but it just takes some time to learn the old dog to sit.

== TODO ==

Maybe add variants for the walls, door frames, windows and roofs. But just takes soooo much time. This mod is already 84 files.....
